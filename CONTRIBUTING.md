# Contributing to HubForge

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the project! Here's how you can help:

## How to Contribute

1. **Create a New Branch**:
   - Branch names should follow the format: `Feature/YourFeatureName` or `Fix/YourFixName`.
   - For example:
     - `Feature-FileView` for a new feature.
     - `Fix-UI-Bug` for a bug fix.
   
2. **Work on Your Feature or Fix**:
   - Make sure your changes are relevant to the branch you created.
   - Try to keep each pull request focused on one feature or fix.

3. **Follow Git Etiquette**:
   - **Commit Often**: Make small, frequent commits to keep changes manageable and easier to review.
   - **Use Descriptive Commit Messages**: Write commit messages that clearly describe what changes have been made. For example, instead of `Update files`, use `Add file view feature to the dashboard`.
   - **Keep Commit History Clean**: If needed, use tools like `rebase` to clean up your commit history before pushing.

4. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**:
   - Once your work is done, push your branch to the repository.
   - Create a pull request (PR) and describe what the PR is doing.
   - PRs must be reviewed by at least one other person before being merged.

5. **Wait for Review**:
   - Your PR will be reviewed, and any feedback or requested changes will be communicated.
   - Make any necessary changes, then wait for approval.

6. **Celebrate!** ðŸŽ‰
   - Once your PR is approved and merged, your contribution is part of the project!

## Additional Notes

- Make sure to sync with the latest `main` branch before submitting your PR.
- Be clear and concise in your commit messages.
- If you're working on a significant feature, please discuss it in advance to avoid duplicated effort.

Thank you for contributing!
